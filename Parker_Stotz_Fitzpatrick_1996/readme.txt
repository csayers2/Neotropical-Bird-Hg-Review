I (Jacob Socolar) obtained the databases in xls format and converted to csv. I cannot personally vouch for the handling of the files between when they were downloaded from the diskette and relayed to me in .xls format. Therefore, there is a remote possibility that the .xls files that I obtained contained minor modifications from the original.
